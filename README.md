# iris project


This short report demonstrate a systematic process for working through multi-class classification Predictive Modeling problems that delivers above average results in Python.






In this project, I will use the Iris Flowers Classification dataset. Each instance in the iris
dataset describes measurements of iris flowers and the task is to predict which species of 3 iris flower the observation belongs. You can learn more about this dataset in the UCI Machine Learning repository website.
